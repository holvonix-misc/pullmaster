## Usage

This is very much alpha - not at all hardened. Use at your own risk.

We eat our own dogfood! The holvonix-open GitHub org uses pullmaster via
@holvonix-bot, and you'll see it in action on our issues and PRs.

**Features:**

* On creation of a pull request, a reviewer with the least code review load will
  be chosen.
* A repository admin can comment on the PR or submit a review to issue a command to the bot:
  * `#shipitnow` - requests an immediate merge, ignoring CI and approval status
  * `#shipit` - requests a merge when CI and approval goes green

When we hit release v1.0.0, we will try to fix our API and use semver to note
changes. Until v1.0.0 (anything below 1.0, and also any 1.0 prereleases), we
will change functionality arbitrarily.
